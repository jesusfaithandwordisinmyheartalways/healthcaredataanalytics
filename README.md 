Healthcare Data Analytics: Billing, Visits & Outcomes

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing healthcare visit and billing data to uncover trends in revenue, patient visits, departments, regions, insurance methods, and outcomes. The dataset is cleaned, enriched, and structured to support Excel analysis, SQL queries, and Tableau dashboards.

The project simulates a real-world healthcare analytics workflow, from raw data cleaning to business-ready reporting.




🎯 Objectives
	•	Clean and standardize raw healthcare billing data
	•	Enrich the dataset with multi-year, regional, insurance, and monthly sales metrics
	•	Enable advanced analytics in Tableau (filters, KPIs, circle charts)
	•	Support SQL-based analysis for departments, visits, and billing trends
	•	Ensure full Excel compatibility on macOS





 Data Cleaning (Python)

Script: scripts/clean_data.py

What it does:
	•	Loads the raw Excel file
	•	Removes rows with missing Billing_Amount
	•	Preserves original column structure
	•	Outputs a cleaned Excel file








🔧 Data Enrichment (Python)

Script: scripts/enrich_data.py

What it adds (without removing existing columns):

📅 Time-Based Fields
	•	Year (2021–2025)
	•	Month (Jan–Dec)
	•	Monthly_Sales (0–60M)

🌎 Geographic Fields
	•	Region (All, Midwest, Northeast, South, Southeast, West)
	•	State (All US state abbreviations)

💳 Financial & Billing Fields
	•	Billing_Method
	•	Medicare
	•	Medicaid
	•	Military/Veterans Benefits
	•	Self Pay (Credit/Debit)
	•	Assistance Programs
	•	Yearly_Billing_Amount
	•	Total_Billing_2021_2025
	•	Total_Company_Billing_By_Year

📊 Tableau-Optimized Metrics
	•	ALL_Visits (global filter value)
	•	Insurance_Total_Sales (circle/pie charts)
	•	Department_Total_Sales






    📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Notebook: notebooks/eda_numpy.ipynb

Analysis performed:
	•	Total, average, and maximum billing amounts
	•	Visit counts by department
	•	Basic NumPy-based aggregation
	•	Data validation before visualization

⸻

🗄️ SQL Analysis

File: sql/queries.sql

Includes:
	•	Total billing by department
	•	Top doctors by visit volume
	•	Running totals using window functions
	•	Department billing averages using CTEs

Designed for PostgreSQL but adaptable to other SQL databases.
